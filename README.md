# Restaurant Review App
This is my repository for my udacity restaurant review app project.The Restaurant Reviews project converts a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application.Accessibility features were implemented and  the webpages have been converted to be responsive  on mobile devices. The site has also been cached for offline use.

## Instructions
- To run the page directly on your computer, download ALL the files from https://github.com/lowlah/omolola-restaurant-review 
- Launch a local client server using Python from your computer's terminal:Run server via terminal with "python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000". Note that this app is dependent on using a live server.
- Visit the site in your browser at http://localhost:8000.
